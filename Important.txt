To make this work on your server, you might also need to configure your web server (like Nginx, Apache, or uWSGI) to have appropriate timeout settings. Here are some recommendations:

If you're using Gunicorn, add these settings to your configuration:
timeout = 300  # 5 minutes
workers = 4
threads = 2

If you're using Nginx as a reverse proxy, add these settings to your server block:
proxy_connect_timeout 300s;
proxy_send_timeout 300s;
proxy_read_timeout 300s;
